## Why
Dashboard is a simple way to build a page featuring all your favorite website. I grew tired of having a ton of bookmark and trying to keep them organized, I wanted a quick way to launch my favorite website/services but I never got around to build something that I would update frequently enough.

By using [Hammer For Mac](http://hammerformac.com), you can quickly build a dashboard with your favorite website links.

Dashboard is already configured to show 12 section with different grouping, social, portfolio, etc. and has multiple pre-configured links.

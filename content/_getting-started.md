## Getting started
Download the template ZIP of get the Github files and install in [Hammer For Mac](http://hammerformac.com).

Create your project and modify the files in the **_user-defined** folder.

Deploy the resulting **build** folder.

You donâ€™t have to know your way around [Hammer For Mac](http://hammerformac.com) but it helps with variables behaviour. I encourage you to go to the website and look around the [docs](http://hammerformac.com/docs/).
